    - Permissions based on Consul voting (e.g., edit locks).  
  - **AI Features**:  
    - Gatekeeper suggests node connections/optimizations (local Llama.cpp).  
    - GPU Burst refinements (paid in Roses).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Performance**: <500ms sync latency, support 100+ nodes.  
  - **Security**: E2E encryption for data, Ed25519 signatures for edits.  
  - **Accessibility**: Screen-reader support, keyboard shortcuts.  
- **Success Metrics**:  
  - 80% Consul adoption, 30% faster task completion vs. standalone apps.

#### **3. Design Brief**  
**Purpose:** Guide UI/UX for intuitive, decentralized collaboration.

  - Canvas workspace (blocks, connectors, task-linked nodes).  
  - Sidebar with Task Manager integration (task list, metadata).  
  - Collaboration panel (live cursors, Consul member status).  
- **Design Principles**:  
  - Minimalist interface (e.g., Figma-like toolbar).  
  - Visual cues for permissions (e.g., "locked" nodes needing Consul votes).  
  - Privacy indicators (e.g., "Gatekeeper-secured" badge).  
- **Accessibility**:  
  - High-contrast mode, keyboard navigation (e.g., Tab to traverse nodes).  
- **Prototypes**:  
  - Wireframes for canvas, task-link modal, version history timeline.

#### **4. Technical Specification Document**  
**Purpose:** Detail architecture, data models, and APIs.  
**Contents:**  
- **System Architecture**:  
  - **Frontend**: Electron + React Flow library for canvas rendering.  
  - **Backend**: Hyperbee for versioned flowcharts, WebRTC for sync.  
- **Data Models**:  
  - **Flowchart Schema**:  
    - Nodes (ID, position, task ID, metadata).  
    - Edges (source/target IDs, label, style).  
    - Version history (Merkle tree hashes).  
  - **Task Integration**:  
    - Task metadata (DIDs, vote hashes) stored in Tier-1 Hypercore feeds.  
- **APIs**:  
  - `/flowchart.sync`: WebRTC-based real-time update protocol.  
  - `/task.fetch`: Fetch task details from Task Manager API.  
- **Security**:  
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for data in transit/rest.  
  - DID-based authentication for edits.

#### **5. Testing & Validation Plan**  
**Purpose:** Ensure functionality, performance, and security.  
**Contents:**  
- **Test Cases**:  
  - Real-time collaboration: 5+ users editing simultaneously.  
  - Task-node linkage: Verify metadata sync with Task Manager.  
  - Undo/redo with Hyperbee versioning.  
- **Security Testing**:  
  - Penetration testing for WebRTC data channels.  
  - Validate Consul vote enforcement for permissioned edits.  
- **Performance Testing**:  
  - Stress test with 1,000-node flowcharts.  
  - Measure AI inference latency (Llama.cpp vs. GPU Burst).

#### **6. Integration Roadmap with Task Manager**  
**Purpose:** Phased feature rollout and dependency management.  
**Contents:**  
- **Phase 1 (MVP – 1-3 months)**:  
  - Basic drag-and-drop flowchart builder.  
  - Manual task-node linking via Task Manager API.  
  - WebRTC syncing for 3-user Consuls.  
- **Phase 2 (AI & Crypto – 3-6 months)**:  
  - Gatekeeper suggests node optimizations.  
  - Auto-generate tasks from "actionable" nodes.  
  - μCredit rewards for high-impact edits.  
- **Phase 3 (Advanced – 6-12 months)**:  
  - GPU Burst integration for complex layouts.  
  - Bananas staking to lock critical flowcharts.
